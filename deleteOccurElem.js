//Problem
// Given a list lst and a number N, create a new list that contains each number of lst at most N times without reordering. For example if N = 2, and the input is [1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], you take [1,2,3,1,2], drop the next [1,2] since this would lead to 1 and 2 being in the result 3 times, and then take 3, which leads to [1,2,3,1,2,3].


//Do I need to keep a count


function deleteNth(arr,n){
    
  }


  const array = (arr) => {
  } 
  

  const array1 = [1,1,2,5,1,2];
  array1.splice(1,3)

  console.log(array1);
